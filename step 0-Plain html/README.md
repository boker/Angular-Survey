##Step 1:
This contains a simple page with a menu. It uses twitter bootstrap for styling(yes it could've been much better, but that's not the intent). The first menu item is Surveys. When a user navigates the site, the expectation is that the first menu item would be selected and the list of surveys would be shown to him.
Each survey line item contains a link to edit it or delete it.
The page also has a button to add a new survey.
The page doesn't contain any code to handle the link clicks etc.
