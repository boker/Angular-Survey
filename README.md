Angular-Survey
==============

This is an attempt to teach angular from scratch, a small step at a time to folks who have probably never worked with any javascript MV* kind of frameworks.
The focus is on learning angular, keeping it simple and not introduce TDD etc. which might make for a separate topic

A hypothetical Survey application has been taken, and only a very small portion of this will be built.. leaving the rest up to the readers as an excercise.
The tutorial is organized as a set of steps (the next step builds on the previous step) as follows:

Step 1: This is a seed html page using twitter bootstrap. The page contains a simple menu, with a static list of surveys.
It contains nothing angular, but what the starting page would look like.

Step 2: This step introduces the very minimal angular bootstrapping. It covers the following:
    - simple bootstrapping
    - controller
    - ng-repeat, to create the list of surveys dynamically
    - {{}} syntax
    - ng-class directive
    - ng-click directive

Step 3: This provides more structure to the above and introduces the following:
    - defining the main application module
    - introduces routing and partial pages

Step 4: This introduces services. In additional it covers the following:
    - $http service
    - Services, Factories and Providers

Step 5: This introduces a new page for survey edit. In the process it covers the following:
    - ng-model
    - Forms
    - validation
    - ng-select
    
Step 6: This introduces the concept of filters


        
Step 7: This step introduces the concept of promises


Step 8: This shows the development of a custom directive


Step 9: Takes a further dive into the world of directives and tries to use a JQuery Plugin internally to provide a declarative interface to JQuery
